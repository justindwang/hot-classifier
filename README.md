# How to run files:

## Make sure required packages are installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- scipy
- biopython

To run "Sequence Generation", you will need to first download a reference genome and place it into a new folder named "genomes". Current files use the [human reference genome](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/referenceSequences/male.hg19.fa.gz) from [Encode Project's ftp](https://www.encodeproject.org/comparative/regulation/).
